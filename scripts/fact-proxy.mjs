// In-job fact-injecting proxy for the OrcaCode Review action.
//
// OCR can only send the auth header (x-api-key / authorization) — it has no way
// to attach custom headers. But the routing DSL routes on `headers[...]`. This
// tiny loopback proxy bridges the gap: OCR talks to it (OCR_LLM_URL points
// here), it stamps the raw-fact headers, and forwards everything —
// including SSE streams — to the real OrcaRouter endpoint.
//
// It is ephemeral: bound to 127.0.0.1 on an OS-assigned port, lives only for
// the duration of one Actions job, and dies with it. Nothing is deployed.
//
// The facts are re-read from CR_FACTS_FILE on EVERY request rather than captured
// at startup, so the driver can change them mid-job without restarting the proxy.
// The file is a flat JSON object of header->value; an absent, empty or
// unparseable file stamps nothing, and the DSL then falls through to its default
// — which is why a broken facts file degrades to "the default model reviewed it"
// instead of failing the run.
//
// Retry: transient upstream failures are retried up to 3 more attempts with
// 1s/2s/4s backoff; a numeric Retry-After header (seconds) wins, capped at
// 30s. WHAT is retryable is deliberately narrow, because a replayed chat
// completion is not idempotent — a duplicate can double-bill:
//   - HTTP 429/502/503/504: a response was received, so the gateway owned the
//     request and answered "not processed" — safe to replay. No other status
//     is ever retried (every other 4xx included).
//   - Connection errors ONLY when they prove the upstream never began
//     processing: ECONNREFUSED / ENOTFOUND / EAI_AGAIN (the connection or name
//     lookup never came up), or any error raised BEFORE the request body
//     finished flushing. An ECONNRESET after the body was fully sent (and
//     before any response) is ambiguous — the gateway may already have
//     consumed and billed the request — so it is surfaced as 502, NOT replayed.
//   - Once a response has started relaying to the client, NOTHING is retried:
//     the response headers are already out, so a mid-stream failure destroys
//     the client connection (fail fast) instead of re-attempting.
// To make replays safe the request body is buffered BEFORE the first attempt,
// capped at 8 MiB: a larger body streams straight through with ALL retries
// disabled for that request (nothing is kept to replay; memory stays bounded).
// A final failure relays the upstream status/body unchanged (502 for a
// connection error). Every response carries x-cr-retry-count (retries actually
// performed) for observability.
//
// Timeout: each upstream attempt is capped (default 120s, CR_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_MS
// / the upstreamTimeoutMs opt override it) so a black-hole gateway (accepts the
// TCP connection, never answers) fails fast into the SAME error handler instead
// of hanging until OCR's own timeout. A pre-response timeout is classified like
// any pre-send connection error (retried only if the body hadn't finished
// flushing — replay stays idempotency-safe); a timeout after the relay started
// tears the client stream down and never retries.
//
// Resilience: the client (OCR) can vanish at any time. A 'close' before the
// response finished cancels the in-flight upstream request (an OCR disconnect
// must not leak a still-billing completion) and blocks any pending retry from
// dialing again; a client-side 'error' is caught (a write to a dead socket must
// not throw an unhandled EPIPE); and the CLI installs a process-level
// uncaughtException backstop that logs and keeps serving — one bad client can
// never take the proxy down mid-job.
//
// Metering (CR_USAGE_FILE): every relayed response gets its `usage` block
// appended as one JSONL record — per-call prompt/completion/cached tokens and
// the model the gateway actually resolved. This is what makes a model's REAL
// per-review cost measurable (unit price alone is misleading: a weaker model
// loops more tool calls, and the prefix-cache hit rate moves the bill more than
// the base rate does). The tap is deliberately non-invasive: it never buffers a
// whole response — it keeps only a bounded TAIL (usage sits at the end of an
// OpenAI-shaped body), so SSE still streams through unbuffered and memory stays
// flat on a multi-MB completion. Extraction and the append are fully soft-fail:
// metering must never alter, delay, or break a review.
//
// Env:
//   ORCAROUTER_URL          full upstream chat-completions URL (origin + path forwarded)
//   CR_FACTS_FILE           path to the JSON facts file the driver rewrites per pass
//   CR_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_MS  optional per-attempt upstream timeout (ms; default 120000)
//   CR_USAGE_FILE           optional JSONL path for per-call token accounting (off when unset)
//   CR_MAX_RPM              optional client-side request ceiling (requests/min; unset = no limit)
// On listen it prints `PROXY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port><upstream-path>` to
// stdout; the driver sets OCR_LLM_URL to that. Auth is forwarded untouched and
// never logged.
//
// Exported for tests: createProxyServer({ upstreamUrl, factsFile,
// policyBlockFile, sleep, maxRetries, maxBufferBytes, usageFile }) returns an
// unlistened http.Server — `sleep` is the injectable backoff seam and
// `maxBufferBytes` the retry-buffer cap. The CLI entry below keeps the original
// env-var + PROXY_URL contract; action.yml usage is unchanged.
