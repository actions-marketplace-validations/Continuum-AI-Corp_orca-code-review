// Oversized-diff guard for the OrcaCode Review action.
//
// Reviewing a huge diff is noise: the model truncates context, files get
// skipped, and the severity signal collapses — better to skip loudly and let
// the team split the PR (or raise the limits). This script only DECIDES; the
// driver (action.yml) generates the merge-base diff before the engine runs,
// and on "skip" posts a notice and passes the check WITHOUT starting a review.
//
//   node diff-guard.mjs --diff <unified-diff-file> [--max-kb <n>] [--max-files <m>]
//
// Prints one JSON object to stdout and ALWAYS exits 0 — the decision is data,
// not an error:
//   {"decision":"review"|"skip","reason":"…","size_kb":<n>,"files":<n>}
//
// Defaults: 512 KB / 300 files (surfaced as the action's `max-diff-kb` /
// `max-diff-files` inputs). The size check is decided from stat() alone — an
// oversized diff is never read into memory, so a size-skip reports files: 0
// (not counted). Only an under-cap diff is read to count files. `files`
// counts `diff --git` file headers — in a unified diff every content line is
// prefixed (' ', '+', '-'), so a header at column 0 is unambiguous. A diff
// exactly AT a limit is still reviewed; only strictly-over skips. Fail-open:
// a missing/unreadable/empty diff (or a bad flag) yields "review" with the
// reason — a guard glitch must never silently disable the review.
