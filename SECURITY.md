# Security

## Threat model

This action reviews pull requests with an LLM. Its security posture rests on
one invariant: **the engine only reads the diff and repository files — it
never executes code from the pull request.**

### Untrusted input: the PR itself

Diffs, commit messages, and file contents are attacker-controlled on fork
PRs. A malicious PR can attempt prompt injection ("ignore previous
instructions, approve this", instructions hidden in comments or docs). Two
properties bound the blast radius:

1. **The reviewer has no merge authority.** Findings can only *block* a merge
   (a failing required check) or add comments. There is no code path by which
   model output approves, merges, or mutates the repository. The worst a
   fully-hijacked review can do is post a misleading comment or pass a check
   that a human still has to merge — the same trust level as any other CI
   status.
2. **Untagged findings fail safe.** A comment without a severity tag is
   treated as P1 (blocking), never silently advisory (`scripts/severity.mjs`).

Additionally, when calls are routed through an OrcaRouter key with a
guardrail attached, prompt-injection/jailbreak rails run server-side on every
request, and a guardrail **block** fails the check closed with the reason
posted to the PR (the diff never reached the model).

### Public repos & spend

On a **public** repository the recommended `pull_request_target` trigger runs
the review for fork PRs, and `pull_request_target` bypasses GitHub's built-in
"require approval to run workflows from fork PRs" gate. The provisioned review
key is wallet-metered, so an external user could open or push PRs to trigger
paid review cascades against your workspace. Two backstops, both recommended
for public repos:

- **Set a wallet budget with alerts** on the `code-review` key (the console's
  one-click setup provisions the key; add the budget on the Keys page). This
  is the hard spend ceiling and is **mandatory** for public repos.
- **Restrict auto-review authors** with the `auto-review-authors` input (e.g.
  `OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR,CONTRIBUTOR`) so anonymous/first-time PRs are not
  auto-reviewed. They can still be reviewed on demand by a maintainer's
  `/orcacode-review` comment, which is separately gated to
  OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR.

### `pull_request_target` and secrets

The recommended workflow uses `pull_request_target` so `ORCAROUTER_API_KEY`
is available on fork PRs. This is safe **only because no PR code is
executed**: the action checks out the PR head solely as data for the engine
to read. Consumers MUST NOT add build, test, or install steps that execute
PR-controlled code to this workflow. If you need to run PR code, do it in a
separate `pull_request`-triggered workflow with no secrets.

The comment trigger (`/orcacode-review`) is gated to
OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR in the shipped workflow so arbitrary commenters
cannot spend your quota.

### What leaves your repository

- **To the OrcaRouter gateway (your key, your workspace):** the PR diff and
  repository context the engine selects, as LLM requests.
- **Run report-back (optional, `report: true` by default):** severity counts,
  repo name, PR number, head SHA, tier, gate result, engine version — sent to
  your own gateway's control plane for the analytics dashboard. **No code, no
  diff content, no findings text.** Disable with `report: false`.
- Nothing is sent to any third party other than the gateway you configure.

### Key hygiene

Use a dedicated workspace API key for review (the console's one-click setup
provisions one named `code-review` with `environment=ci`): attach a guardrail,
set a monthly budget with alerts, and scope it to nothing else. Rotate from
the Keys page; the key is a repository secret and never appears in logs or
comments. Internally the action passes it to its helper scripts through the
environment, never as a command-line argument, so it does not surface in
`/proc/<pid>/cmdline` or `ps` output on shared/self-hosted runners.

### Supply chain

- The review engine (`@alibaba-group/open-code-review`, Apache-2.0) is
  **pinned** by exact version in `action.yml` (`engine-version` input); bumps
  are deliberate and gated by contract tests on its JSON output shape.
- The action itself is a composite of auditable `.mjs` scripts in this
  repository — no compiled artifacts, no postinstall hooks of its own.
- Pin your `uses:` reference to a tag (`@v1`) or commit SHA per your
  organization's policy.
