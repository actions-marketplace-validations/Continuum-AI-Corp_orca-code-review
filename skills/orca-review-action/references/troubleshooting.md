# Troubleshooting

Collect evidence first. A guess costs more than a command.

```bash
gh run list --workflow orca-code-review.yml --limit 5
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
gh secret list | grep ORCAROUTER_API_KEY
```

## No workflow run appears at all

The job never started, so there are no logs. Work down this list:

| Check | How | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow exists **on the base branch** | `git show origin/<default>:.github/workflows/orca-code-review.yml` | `pull_request_target` reads the workflow from the base branch, not the PR head. A workflow added only in the PR branch will not run until it merges. |
| App is enabled | OrcaRouter → Apps → OrcaCode Review | Turn it on. |
| `auto_review` is on | Dashboard | Off means no automatic reviews. `/orcacode-review` still works. |
| PR is not a draft | `gh pr view --json isDraft` | With `trigger: ready_for_review`, drafts are skipped by design. Mark it ready. |
| Author is allowed | `gh pr view --json authorAssociation` | If it is outside `auto-review-authors`, a maintainer can run `/orcacode-review`. |
| Actions are enabled | Repo Settings → Actions | Forked repos ship with Actions disabled. |

## `/orcacode-review` does nothing

The comment gate requires **both**: the comment starts with one of
`/orcacode-review`, `/orcacode review`, `@orcacode-review`, `@orcacode review`
(a leading space or quote breaks `startsWith`), **and** the commenter's
`author_association` is `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR`.

An outside contributor commenting the command is silently ignored. That is
deliberate — the command runs a privileged workflow holding the paid key.

## Run fails immediately with an auth error

| Cause | Tell |
| --- | --- |
| Secret missing or misnamed | `gh secret list` shows no `ORCAROUTER_API_KEY`. The name is exact and case-sensitive. |
| Secret set on an environment or another repo | Repository secrets and environment secrets are different scopes. The job reads repository (or org) secrets. |
| Key revoked or out of budget | Check <https://www.orcarouter.ai/console/token>. A wallet at its limit returns an auth-shaped failure. |
| Fork PR | Secrets are unavailable to `pull_request` from forks — which is exactly why the shipped workflow uses `pull_request_target`. If someone replaced the trigger, that is the bug. |

## "Diff too large" notice, check is red

Working as configured. The guard runs before the engine, so nothing was spent.

- Split the PR — the real fix, and it reviews better.
- Or raise `max-diff-kb` / `max-diff-files`.
- Or set `on-oversized-diff: "pass"` to make the skip advisory. Understand the
  trade first: with a required check, `pass` means a big enough PR can walk
  straight through the gate unreviewed.

## Review runs, but no comments appear

| Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Nothing was found | A clean run posts a summary, not inline comments. Check the job log's severity counts. |
| Quiet mode | P2 findings are muted at posting time. The gate and report still counted them — the log will show a nonzero P2. |
| Precision filter dropped them | L1 drops findings whose `existing_code` snippet does not match the reviewed commit; L2 drops low-confidence clusters. Lower `judge-threshold`, or set `precision-filter: "false"` to see raw output. |
| Missing permissions | The job needs `pull-requests: write` and `issues: write`. |

## Reviews work, but the console's Settings and Analytics tabs are empty

`@v1` points at a commit that predates `scripts/settings.mjs` and
`scripts/report.mjs`. Settings are never fetched and runs are never reported —
**with no error message**. Two dead tabs and working reviews is the signature.

Verify against the action repo:

```bash
git ls-tree v1 scripts/ | grep -E 'settings|report'
```

Fix by pinning a newer tag or an immutable commit SHA instead of `@v1`.

## Findings look wrong or noisy

- Tighten the rubric at **OrcaRouter → Apps → OrcaCode Review**.
- Raise `judge-threshold` above `0.5` to drop more low-confidence findings.
- Set `judge-model` to something other than the reviewer model — a judge that is
  the same model is not an independent second opinion.
- Turn on quiet mode to keep P2 out of the PR while still counting it.

## Every PR gets two sets of comments

Something besides this workflow is also reviewing. Most often the OrcaCode
Review **GitHub App** is installed on the repo — this skill does not install it,
but somebody may have added it directly. Both review the same pull requests, so
the repo pays twice and the author reads everything twice.

| Check | How |
| --- | --- |
| This workflow | `git show origin/<default>:.github/workflows/orca-code-review.yml` |
| Something else | A bot review, or a check on a recent PR that no workflow in the repo produces |

Keep one. Removing the workflow is the reversible half — delete it, dropping the
required check first. Revoking an App installation is a permission change only
someone with admin rights can make.

## Merges are not actually blocked

A red check blocks nothing until it is required. Add **`review`** under
**Settings → Branches / Rulesets → Require status checks to pass**.

Also confirm `block-on` is not `""`, and that the reviewed severities are the ones
you expect — with the dashboard authoritative, `block_on` may have been changed in
the console rather than in the file.

## The run times out

`timeout-minutes` (default 20) is a ceiling on **one** engine pass. Exceeding it
fails closed with a distinct "wall-clock timeout" error, separate from
"no usable result" — the log says which. Raise it for very large diffs or
slow-per-call models, or lower `concurrency` if the model is rate-limiting and the
retries are what is eating the clock.
